# [19. Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)
> Remove the $n$-th node from the end of a linked list. 
### Input
* `head`: Head node of a linked list.
	* The number of nodes in the list isÂ `sz`.
	* `1 <= sz <= 30`
	* `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
* `n`: Position of a node to be removed.
	* `1 <= n <= sz`
### Output
The head node of the linked list with the specified node being removed.
### Example
```
Input: head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], n = 2
Output: [1, 2, 3, 5]
```
### Idea
#### 1. Two  Passes
The most intuitive solution is to traverse the linked list twice,
1. Derive length of the linked list, so the node to be removed is located.
2. Remove the specified node by repointing the `next` pointer of `n+1` node to `n-1` node.
```python
# Ignore
```
* Time complexity: $O(n)$
	* Each traversal takes $O(n)$.
* Space complexity: $O(1)$
#### 2. One Pass
To avoid traversing the linked list twice, we can use slow and fast pointers to help us determine in which half the `n`-th node is located. The concept is summarized as follows,
1. Use slow and fast pointers to derive the middle point.
2. Derive the length of the linked list.
3. Initialize the pointer based on the location of the node to remove.
	*  Either start from the first or the second half.
4. Remove the `n`-th node.

This process looks quite annoying, let's discuss another solution in idea 3.
```python
def removeNthFromEnd(head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
    if head is None or head.next is None:
        return None

    dummy = ListNode(0, next=head)
    slow, fast = dummy, dummy.next
    mid = 0
    while fast is not None and fast.next is not None:
        mid += 1
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next

    ll_len = (mid + 1) * 2 - 1 if fast is None else (mid + 1) * 2
    n_forward = ll_len - n
    p = dummy if n_forward <= mid else slow  # Start from the first or second half
    n_steps = n_forward - 1 if p == dummy else n_forward - mid - 1
    cnt = 0
    while cnt < n_steps:
        cnt += 1
        p = p.next
    p.next = p.next.next

    return dummy.next
```
* Time complexity: $O(n)$
	* Locating the middle point then traversing only a half of the linked list takes $O(n)$.
* Space complexity: $O(1)$
#### 3. Concise One Pass
We find that `n` is actually the **offset** of the node to remove and the tail (`None`) of the linked list. Hence, the core idea is to use two pointers which has a gap to locate the node to remove. We have two choices here,
1. `offset == n + 1` represents the gap between the node before the one to remove and `None`.
2. `offset == n` represents the gap between the node before the one to remove and the last node.

To be concrete, we need to repoint `next` pointer of `n+1`-th node to `n-1`-th.

```python
def removeNthFromEnd(head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
    dummy = ListNode(0, next=head)
    l, r = dummy, head
    while n > 0:
        r = r.next
        n -= 1

    while r is not None:
        l = l.next
        r = r.next
    l.next = l.next.next

    return dummy.next
```
* Time complexity: $O(n)$
	* Traversing the linked list exactly once.
* Space complexity: $O(1)$
##### Comment
* This solution can also be implemented without the dummy node. Note that one edge case in which **the first node** is removed should be handled.
```python
def removeNthFromEnd(head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
    l, r = head, head
    while n > 0:
        r = r.next
        n -= 1
    if r is None:
        return head.next

    while r.next is not None:
        l = l.next
        r = r.next
    l.next = l.next.next

    return head
```
